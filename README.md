# 📱 GraphicPlus

**GraphicPlus** is a modern mobile application built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, designed as a complete revamp of the college’s legacy **web-based student portal**.  

The earlier portal suffered from a **slow and laggy interface** with a **PHP-based backend**, which often led to poor user experience and limited scalability.  
To address this, **GraphicPlus** was developed with a **modernized architecture** — featuring a **FastAPI** backend with **MongoDB** and **AWS Cloud integration**, alongside a **clean, responsive mobile UI** optimized for performance and usability.

With **GraphicPlus**, over **1,500+ students** now experience a faster, more intuitive platform for managing **attendance**, **college notices**, and **event registrations**, anytime and anywhere.
